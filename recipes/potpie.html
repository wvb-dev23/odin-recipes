        <h2>Easy Chicken Pot Pie</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed</li>
            <li>Vegetables of your choice, chopped</li>
            <li>⅓ cup butter</li>
            <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>spices</li>
            <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery in a saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed</li>
            <li>Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place chicken and vegetables in the bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over top.</li>
            <li>Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
